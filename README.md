Slides from my talk, "Don’t reinvent the wheel: making use of shiny extension packages", at a Münster R User Group [event](https://www.meetup.com/Munster-R-Users-Group/events/257889907/).

The slides contain links and images related to various packages, but without much other background information. I'll cover the same topic as part of my week on the 
[R-Ladies Rotating Curator account](https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies)
(18-23 Feb) and (eventually) collect the notes in 
[this repo](https://github.com/sowla/2019-RLadies-RoCur).
